## Algorithmic puzzle solutions

Despite the repo name, I add solutions from multiple sites, not just CodinGame. The code is frequently refactored
as I get better at this. At least, that's the plan.

Full disclosure: this repo is not intended to showcase my algorithmic chops, such as they are, but serves as a reference point for algo exercises. 
So, if I cannot solve a question in a reasonable amount of time, I look up the answer, and often commit a slightly modified version of it, citing the original in the solution.
